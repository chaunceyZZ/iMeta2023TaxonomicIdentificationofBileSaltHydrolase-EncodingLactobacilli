## Abstract
Bile salt hydrolases (BSHs) are the enzymes that are essential for the enterohepatic metabolism of bile acids (BAs). They catalyze the production of unconjugated BAs and regulate the homeostasis of the BA pool. This study identified Lactobacillus as a crucial BSH-encoding genus based on multivariate analysis of the abundance, diversity, deconjugation ability, specific activity, the number of encoded BSH phylotypes and the number of related diseases. Then, 16 main species of lactobacilli, which encode three BSH phylotypes, were characterized using metagenomic data from publicly available human gut microbiome databases. These include Limosilactobacillus. fermentum, Latilactobacillus. sakei, Lacticaseibacillus. casei, Lacticaseibacillus. rhamnosus, and Lacticaseibacillus. paracasei (BSH-T0); Ligilactobacillus. animalis, Limosilactobacillus. mucosae, Ligilactobacillus. ruminis, Lactiplantibacillus. plantarum, Ligilactobacillus. murinus, and Lactobacillus. delbrueckii (BSH-T2); Limosilactobacillus. reuteri, Lactobacillus. amylovorus, Lactobacillus. acidophilus, and Lactobacillus. gasseri (BSH-T3); Ligilactobacillus. salivarius encoded both BSH-T0 and BSH-T3. The lactobacilli strains encoding BSH-T3 exhibited the highest in vitro deconjugation activities against the seven conjugated BAs. Furthermore, in vivo studies in mice administered four representative lactobacilli strains encoding different BSH phylotypes, showed that treatment with BSH-T3-encoding Limosilactobacillus. reuteri altered the structure of the gut microbiome and metabolome, significantly increased the levels of unconjugated BAs and total BAs excretion. Our findings facilitated the taxonomic identification of crucial BSH-encoding lactobacilli in human gut microbiota and shed light on their contributions to modulating the enterohepatic circulation of BAs, which will contribute to future therapeutic applications of BSH-encoding probiotics to improve human health.
